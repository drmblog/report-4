{"name":"Assignment 4 - Lab Report","tagline":"#EURDRM2015","body":"# Introduction:\r\nFor the purpose of last assignment the graph was created for a semantic network based on the relevant news data. \r\n\r\n# Process\r\nData was gather with Lexis Nexis power search. The search query was «North Korea» and it was limited to major world publications  which occurred in the period of last three months. The full dataset included 188 unique articles. Data was then processed in Context using Network Construction function specifically designed for Lexis Nexis data. After that, the map was created using the VOS viewer software with the help of full counting method. Each viz was slightly modified using internal VOS viewer setting, which are quite limited.  \r\n![VOS viewer](https://github.com/drmblog/report-4/blob/master/1.png?raw=true)\r\nAn entity-based network was also created using Context software for the same dataset. The distance parameter was set to 25. This step produced several semantic network files, one of which was ready to be directly loaded in Gephi software as well as yEd graph editor software. \r\n![Gephi load](https://github.com/drmblog/report-4/blob/master/2.png?raw=true) Force Atlas method was used in order to reorganize the graph. After that modularity test was executed, as well as some others analysis to measure nodes centrality.\r\n![Gephi graph](https://github.com/drmblog/report-4/blob/master/3.png?raw=true) The graph was colorized depending on the modularity attribute of nodes.\r\n![Gephi color](https://github.com/drmblog/report-4/blob/master/4.png?raw=true)\r\nAfter that the spread distance was changed several time and the nodes labels were turned to be shown on the graph. Minor tweaks enabled the graph to become a bit more readable. \r\n![Gephi tweaks](https://github.com/drmblog/report-4/blob/master/5.png?raw=true)\r\n![Gephi tweaks](https://github.com/drmblog/report-4/blob/master/6.png?raw=true)\r\n![Gephi tweaks](https://github.com/drmblog/report-4/blob/master/7.png?raw=true)\r\n![Gephi tweaks](https://github.com/drmblog/report-4/blob/master/8.png?raw=true)\r\n![Gephi tweaks](https://github.com/drmblog/report-4/blob/master/9.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nIt was possible to identify several «small worlds» on the graph, one of which was strongly linked to the Middle East context. \r\n![Gephi tweaks](https://github.com/drmblog/report-4/blob/master/10.png?raw=true)\r\n![Gephi tweaks](https://github.com/drmblog/report-4/blob/master/11.png?raw=true)\r\n![Gephi tweaks](https://github.com/drmblog/report-4/blob/master/12.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, all possible stable releases (including new 0.9) of Gephi could not take me further than those steps. Each time I tried to make any changes I got crashes, freezes or simple interface rendering issues, which did not even allow me to turn back the labels off for the existing graph. I only once was lucky enough to get to the «data» screen, which freezed the time after I tried to make a simple click. \r\n![Gephi bug](https://github.com/drmblog/report-4/blob/master/13.png?raw=true)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
